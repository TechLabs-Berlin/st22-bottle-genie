The Bottle Genie app is a digital recycling assistant that helps the residents of Berlin (expats and new residents being the target users) understand the German bottle and can deposit system (*Pfandsystem*). The app guides its user every step of the way from learning about the deposit system in general to finding the best place to return their empty bottles and cans. The user can decide whether to simply scan the bottle/can or to use a manual search function to find out where they can return the container. If the bottle or can is returnable, both features display a result with the most suitable return location shown on the map, as well as the deposit value.
